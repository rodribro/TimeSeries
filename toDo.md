### <b> 1. EDA </b>
* Perform one-hot enconding in order to create a correlation matrix
* Plot graphs for variables of interest

### <b> 2. ML model benchmarking </b>

* Test as a Classification task to get a baseline for prediction accuracy and errors
* Test a TimeSeries approach (eventhough it might need to be treared as an irregular timeseries due to lack of data)
